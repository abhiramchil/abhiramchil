## 👋 About Me

🌐 I'm currently interested in **Cloud Technologies** and exploring how they can transform applications and systems.

👯 I love collaborating on **Open Source Projects**, especially those involving machine learning, Android development, and full-stack applications.

🎓 I'm pursuing my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at Georgia Tech (GPA: 3.77/4.0), with coursework focused on Data Structures & Algorithms, Database Systems, AI, and more.

✨ Currently interning on an **AI-powered crowdsourcing platform** at Vertically Integrated Projects, leveraging PyTorch and RESTful APIs to build intelligent matchmaking solutions.

📚 **Teaching Assistant** at Georgia Tech, helping students master Python and foundational computer science concepts.

🚀 **Projects I've Worked On:**
- **Smart Loan Evaluator:** Built predictive neural network models using Python, PyTorch, and Flask, paired with intuitive front-end visualizations.
- **WanderSync:** Developed a full-stack Android app for seamless travel planning, using Firebase for real-time collaboration.
- **iTunes Gallery:** Designed and implemented a JavaFX app integrated with the iTunes API to visually explore music.

🎲 Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in less than 15 seconds!
